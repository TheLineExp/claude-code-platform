# claude-code-platform — repo guide

Single source of truth for Mike's Claude Code dev system on this Mac. `~/.claude` is
generated FROM this repo — see docs/AUDIT-2026-07-02.md for why.

## Layout

- `platform/global/` — canonical layer synced to `~/.claude`:
  - `skills/` — 9 skills (doctrine, feature, graphify, letsbuild, pm, route, shipit, todo, traceability-review)
  - `agents/` — parity-sweep, money-concurrency-reviewer, traceability-reviewer
  - `hooks/` — the git-safety guard hooks (block-*, check-*, enforce-worktree, deps
    `_parse-input.sh`/`_config.sh`/`_tokenize.pl`). GLOBAL: they fire for every session via
    `~/.claude/settings.json`, not per-repo. Universal guards (no-verify, destructive-git,
    gh-merge, rebase) run everywhere; worktree-discipline hooks self-gate on a registered
    `.claude/active-work.md` (via `_fleet_active`), while block-protected-branch gates on a
    `.claude/` dir existing (`_fleet_shaped` — fail-CLOSED even if active-work.md is emptied;
    audit A8). Guards match on the normalized ARGV MODEL emitted by ONE shell-faithful
    tokenizer (`_tokenize.pl`, sourced via `_parse-input.sh`) — never string regex, so the
    git and writer surfaces cannot drift and a flag literal inside a quoted `-m` message is
    just one token the guard skips (audit A9). Policy (`_config.sh`) is hardcoded — no
    platform.config.json. `_tokenize.pl` is a hard dependency: setup-machine.sh mirrors
    `*.sh` + `*.pl`, and without it the guards fail OPEN.
    **Any hook edit must run `platform/tests/hook-bypass-suite.sh` (194) AND
    `platform/tests/hook-grammar-fuzz.sh` (CLEAN) before AND after — canonical and live.**
  - `backlog-gate.js` (PreToolUse hook), `statusline-command.sh`
  - `claude-CLAUDE.template.md` → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; `claude-settings.template.json` → `~/.claude/settings.json`
  - `graphify-autoquery.js` — retired from deployment; kept in repo only
- `setup-machine.sh` — the ONLY writer of `~/.claude`. Default = sync (with backup); `--diff` = report drift, no writes
- `docs/` — architecture, setup, reference
- `backlog/` — cross-repo /todo + /feature store

## Hard rules

1. **Never hand-edit `~/.claude`.** Edit `platform/global/` here, then run
   `./setup-machine.sh`. Hand edits are overwritten on next sync and never reach git.
2. **Keep `platform/global/skills/*` and `~/.claude/skills/*` identical.** Run
   `./setup-machine.sh --diff` before committing; resolve any drift first.
3. Paths under `/Users/mikekunz/Documents/Volo Technologies/` contain a space — always
   quote them (space-free symlink: `~/vt`).
4. gstack-ship / gstack-review are retired; there is no azure-ops repo. Don't reintroduce
   references.
